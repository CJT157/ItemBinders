Ever wanted to combine items into a better version of themselves? Ever wanted to transform your items into disfigured and poorly combined versions of themselves?

If you said yes to one of these questions, this mod is for you.

Using the powers of the Binders, you can become the Master of Combinations, which allow you to combine many different weapons!

If there is anything you would like to have combined, please message me or reply to the main thread, I will most likely add it in.

Also I am now back, hopefully I can start bring new updates more often.
